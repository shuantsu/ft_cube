# Filipe Teixeira's Cube Simulator

This program was developed with the aim of being lightweight and containing only the absolutely essential to represent an NxN rubik's cube.

This simulator accepts any algorithm in the official notation and returns a representation of the puzzle that can be rendered afterwards.

It can be easily extended to render the puzzle in any desired format (the renderer.js script), but it also provides out-of-the-box two formats: a navigable 3D reconstruction-like view and a cube net of a determined state.
